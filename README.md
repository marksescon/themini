Mini OD/Fuzz files

Disclaimer: I have built the circuit. It works. I am not responsible for any harm or injury that may arise from building this pedal. I have no association with the original builder/designer of the Mini. Product names are for comparison purposes only. For assistance troubleshooting, please refer to the multitude of online forums available like r/diypedals.

Update - 10/15/2022

The Gerber files are NOT working. I will be uploading the PCBs to OSHPARK for the time being.

The following files are included (as of 8/29/2022):
- MINIPCB_BuildInstructions.pdf = Build instructions.
- MINI_THROUGHHOLE_2022-08-21.zip = Gerber files for through-hole version of pedal.
- mini_smt_2022-08-21.zip = Gerber files for SMT version.
- MINI_drilltemplate-0821.pdf = Proposed drill template.
