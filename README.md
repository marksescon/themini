Mini OD/Fuzz files

Disclaimer: Please double-check my work to ensure this circuit will work. I have built the pedal. It works. However, I cannot guarantee a fully functioning pedal and/or promise that the PCB is error-free. Proceed with caution. I am not responsible for any harm or injury that may arise from building this pedal. I have no association with the original builder/designer of the Mini. Product names are for comparison purposes only. For assistance troubleshooting, please refer to the multitude of online forums available like r/diypedals on Reddit.
